The Carbon Grove project is a gamified eco-friendly digital platform designed to promote sustainable living through engaging and impactful user experiences. The app encourages users to reduce their carbon footprint by rewarding eco-friendly actions such as reducing electricity
consumption and recycling organic waste. Users earn points that can be used to grow a personalized virtual garden, which directly translates to real-world benefits like the delivery of fresh organic produce or
participation in composting initiatives.
The platform partners with organic farming and waste management organizations to create a seamless loop of sustainability.
It features a user-friendly interface, carbon tracking, gamification elements, and social sharing to inspire widespread adoption. The app is designed for mobile use and focuses on empowering users in regions 
where organic farming is prevalent, making sustainable living both fun and rewarding. By integrating real-world actions with virtual rewards, Carbon Grove bridges the gap between individual efforts and 
community impact in the fight against climate change.

To run a React Native app, you typically start by executing npm start in your project directory. This command launches the Metro Bundler, a development server that optimizes and serves your app's JavaScript code to the device. Metro Bundler acts as the bridge between your code and the app, enabling real-time updates and debugging during development. To view the app on a physical phone, you can use the Expo Go app, which provides a convenient way to run and test React Native apps. Once Metro Bundler is running, a QR code is displayed in the terminal or browser. Simply open Expo Go on your phone, scan the QR code, and the app will load on your device. This seamless workflow allows developers to quickly see changes and test functionality without the need for a full build process.
